# Table-Price

Mythral Artifice is a VTTRPG Table making company that combines the functionality of a VTT with the classic DND experience of sitting at a table. As a founding member, I want to know what price should we charge for the table on our kickstarter to make the most profit. I need to gether data on previous successful Kickstarters and find the trend line for the price of the table, then calculate the cost of the table to produce, then find the point that they intersect to determine the best price for profit.

Business Question:
What price should my Kickstarter table be for the most profit?
